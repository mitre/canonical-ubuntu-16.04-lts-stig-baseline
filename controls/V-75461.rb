  title "The Ubuntu operating system must employ a FIPS 140-2 approved
cryptographic hashing algorithms for all stored passwords."
  desc  "The system must use a strong hashing algorithm to store the password.
The system must use a sufficient number of hashing rounds to ensure the
required level of entropy.

    Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard
method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be
plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised.
