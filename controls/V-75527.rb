  desc  "Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the
overall security of the Ubuntu operating system. This requirement ensures the
software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted
vendor.

    Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or Ubuntu operating
system components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by
the organization.

    Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates
the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. Setting the
\"Verify-Peer\" Boolean will determine whether or not the server's host
certificate should be verified against trusted certificates. This ensures the
software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted
vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement. The Ubuntu
operating system should not have to verify the software again. This requirement
does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however, the certificate
used to verify the software must be from an approved CA.
