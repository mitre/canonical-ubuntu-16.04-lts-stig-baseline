  title "The Ubuntu operating system must implement non-executable data to
protect its memory from unauthorized code execution."
  desc  "Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in
non-executable regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited.
Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data
execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution
prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with
hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.

    Examples of attacks are buffer overflow attacks.
