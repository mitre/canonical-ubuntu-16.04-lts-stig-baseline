  title "Pam_Apparmor must be configured to allow system administrators to pass
information to any other Ubuntu operating system administrator or user, change
security attributes, and to confine all non-privileged users from executing
functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security
safeguards/countermeasures."
  desc  "Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that
individual users are \"owners\" of objects and therefore have discretion over
who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or
write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object
or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who
will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes
user-controlled file permissions.

    When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are
not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for
which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been
granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the
subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or
objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access
Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints
of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints
preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a
different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the
information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded
by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside the
control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure
the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions
of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that
limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.
