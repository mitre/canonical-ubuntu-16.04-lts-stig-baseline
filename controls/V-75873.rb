  desc  "Source-routed packets allow the source of the packet to suggest that
routers forward the packet along a different path than configured on the
router, which can be used to bypass network security measures. This requirement
applies only to the forwarding of source-routed traffic, such as when IPv4
forwarding is enabled and the system is functioning as a router."
