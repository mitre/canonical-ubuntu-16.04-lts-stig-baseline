Check to see if Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is installed
with the following command:

# dpkg -l |grep aide

ii aide 0.16~a2.git20130520-3
ii aide-common 0.16~a2.git20130520-3

If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity
checks are performed on the system.

If there is no application installed to perform integrity checks, this is a
finding.

Note: AIDE is highly configurable at install time. These commands assume the
\"aide.conf\" file is under the \"/etc\" directory.

Use the following command to determine if the file is in another location:

# find / -name aide.conf

Check the \"aide.conf\" file to determine if the \"xattrs\" rule has been added
to the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists
with the following command:

# egrep \"[+]?xattrs\" /etc/aide/aide.conf

VarFile = OwnerMode+n+l+X+xattrs

If the \"xattrs\" rule is not being used on all selection lines in the
\"/etc/aide.conf\" file, or extended attributes are not being checked by
another file integrity tool, this is a finding."

If AIDE is installed, ensure the \"xattrs\" rule is present on all file and
