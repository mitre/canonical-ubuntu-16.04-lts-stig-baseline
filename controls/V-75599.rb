the errors. Error messages are an indicator of an organization's operational
state or can identify the Ubuntu operating system or platform. Additionally,
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and operational information must not
be revealed through error messages to unauthorized personnel or their
designated representatives.

    The structure and content of error messages must be carefully considered by
the organization and development team. The extent to which the information
system is able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by
