  desc  "The organization must identify authorized software programs and permit
execution of authorized software. The process used to identify software
programs that are authorized to execute on organizational information systems
is commonly referred to as whitelisting.

    Utilizing a whitelist provides a configuration management method for
allowing the execution of only authorized software. Using only authorized
software decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities.
Verification of white-listed software occurs prior to execution or at system
startup.

    Users' home directories/folders may contain information of a sensitive
nature. Non-privileged users should coordinate any sharing of information with
an SA through shared resources.
