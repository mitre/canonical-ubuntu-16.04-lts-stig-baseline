Check the system configuration to determine the partition the audit records are
being written to with the following command:

# sudo grep log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log

Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to (with the
example being \"/var/log/audit/\"):

# df -h /var/log/audit/
1.0G /var/log/audit

If the audit records are not being written to a partition specifically created
for audit records (in this example \"/var/log/audit\" is a separate partition),
determine the amount of space other files in the partition are currently
occupying with the following command:

# du -sh <partition>
1.0G /var

Determine what the threshold is for the system to take action when 75% of the
repository maximum audit record storage capacity is reached:

# grep -i space_left /etc/audit/auditd.conf
space_left = 250

If the value of the \"space_left\" keyword is not set to 25% of the total
partition size, this is a finding."
