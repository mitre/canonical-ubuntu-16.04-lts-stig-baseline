Codes (MACs) employing FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hash algorithms."
  desc  "Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be
altered by unauthorized users without detection.

    Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by
an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an
external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include,
for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information
include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography
enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while
maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.
