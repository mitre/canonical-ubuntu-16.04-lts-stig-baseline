Use the following command to determine if the file is in a location other than
\"/etc/aide/aide.conf\":

# find / -name aide.conf

Check the \"aide.conf\" file to determine if the \"acl\" rule has been added to
the rule list being applied to the files and directories selection lists with
the following command:

# egrep \"[+]?acl\" /etc/aide/aide.conf

VarFile = OwnerMode+n+l+X+acl

another file integrity tool, this is a finding."
