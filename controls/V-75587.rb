  desc "check", "Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created
for non-privileged local interactive user home directories.

Check the home directory assignment for all non-privileged users, users with a
User Identifier (UID) greater than 1000, on the system with the following
command:

# awk -F: '($3>=1000)&&($1!=\"nobody\"){print $1,$3,$6}' /etc/passwd

adamsj 1001  /home/adamsj
jacksonm 1002 /home/jacksonm
smithj  1003 /home/smithj

The output of the command will give the directory/partition that contains the
home directories for the non-privileged users on the system (in this example,
\"/home\") and usersâ€™ shell. All accounts with a valid shell (such as
/bin/bash) are considered interactive users.

Check that a file system/partition has been created for the non-privileged
interactive users with the following command:

Note: The partition of \"/home\" is used in the example.

# grep /home /etc/fstab
UUID=333ada18    /home                   ext4    noatime,nobarrier,nodev  1 2

non-privileged interactive users' home directories does not exist, this is a
finding."
