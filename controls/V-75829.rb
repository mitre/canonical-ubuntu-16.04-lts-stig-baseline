  title "The Ubuntu operating system must implement DoD-approved encryption to
protect the confidentiality of SSH connections."
  desc  "Without confidentiality protection mechanisms, unauthorized
individuals may gain access to sensitive information via a remote access
session.

    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an
authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external,
non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for
example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    Encryption provides a means to secure the remote connection to prevent
unauthorized access to the data traversing the remote access connection (e.g.,
RDP), thereby providing a degree of confidentiality. The encryption strength of
a mechanism is selected based on the security categorization of the information.
