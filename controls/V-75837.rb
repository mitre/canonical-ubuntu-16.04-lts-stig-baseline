  title "The Ubuntu operating system for all network connections associated
with SSH traffic must immediately terminate at the end of the session or after
10 minutes of inactivity."
  desc  "Automatic session termination addresses the termination of
user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network
connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network
disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is
initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an
organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and
thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.

    Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's
logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the
user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.

    Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can
include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted
responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on
information system use.

    This capability is typically reserved for specific Ubuntu operating system
functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires
additional assurance.
