Check that a file system/partition has been created for the system audit data

Note: /var/log/audit is used as the example as it is a common location.

#grep /var/log/audit /etc/fstab

If a separate entry for \"/var/log/audit\" does not exist, ask the System

system/partition on the system, then grep for that file system/partition.

If a separate file system/partition does not exist for the system audit data
