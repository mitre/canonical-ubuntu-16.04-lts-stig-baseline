  title "The Ubuntu operating system must enforce password complexity by
requiring that at least one lower-case character be used."
  desc  "Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources
required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a
measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing
and brute-force attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it
takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the
number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is
compromised.
