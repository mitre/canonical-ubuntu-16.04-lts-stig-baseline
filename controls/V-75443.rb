  title "The Ubuntu operating system must limit the number of concurrent
sessions to ten for all accounts and/or account types."
  desc  "Ubuntu operating system management includes the ability to control the
number of users and user sessions that utilize an Ubuntu operating system.
Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user is helpful in
reducing the risks related to DoS attacks.

    This requirement addresses concurrent sessions for information system
accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple
system accounts. The maximum number of concurrent sessions should be defined
based upon mission needs and the operational environment for each system.
