  title "The Ubuntu operating system must use cryptographic mechanisms to
protect the integrity of audit tools."
  desc  "Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a
critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit
information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and
audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

    Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open
source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information
system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report
generators.

    It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code
into the existing tools with the purpose of providing the capability to hide or
erase system activity from the audit logs.

    To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed in order
to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified,
manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or files.
