Check that the Ubuntu operating system displays the Standard Mandatory DoD
Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the Ubuntu operating system
via a ssh logon with the following command:

# grep -i banner /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Banner=/etc/issue.net

The command will return the banner option along with the name of the file that
contains the ssh banner. If the line is commented out this is a finding.

Check the specified banner file to check that it matches the Standard Mandatory
DoD Notice and Consent Banner exactly:
