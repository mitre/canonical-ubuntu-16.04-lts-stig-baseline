moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but
does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.

    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be
determined.

    Regardless of where the session lock is determined and implemented, once
invoked, the session lock shall remain in place until the user
re-authenticates. No other activity aside from re-authentication shall unlock
the system.
