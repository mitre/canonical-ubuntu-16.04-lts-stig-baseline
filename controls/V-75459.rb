  title "The Ubuntu operating system must encrypt all stored passwords with a
FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hashing algorithm."
  desc  "Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the
standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they
can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised.

    Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic
module are not verified and therefore cannot be relied upon to provide
confidentiality or integrity, and DoD data may be compromised.

    FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to
access cryptographic modules utilize authentication that meets DoD requirements.
