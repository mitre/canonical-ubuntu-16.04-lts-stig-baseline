Note: SSH public key files may be found in other directories on the system
depending on the installation.

The following command will find all SSH public key files on the system:

# ls -l /etc/ssh/*.pub

-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  618 Nov 28 06:43 ssh_host_dsa_key.pub
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  347 Nov 28 06:43 ssh_host_key.pub
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  238 Nov 28 06:43 ssh_host_rsa_key.pub

If any key.pub file has a mode more permissive than \"0644\", this is a
finding."
  tag "fix": "Note: SSH public key files may be found in other directories on
the system depending on the installation.

Change the mode of public host key files under \"/etc/ssh\" to \"0644\" with
the following command:

# sudo chmod 0644 /etc/ssh/*key.pub

The SSH daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect. To restart the
SSH daemon, run the following command:

# sudo systemctl restart sshd.service"
