  title "The Ubuntu operating system must allow only the Information System
Security Manager (ISSM) (or individuals or roles appointed by the ISSM) to
select which auditable events are to be audited."
  desc  "Without the capability to restrict which roles and individuals can
select which events are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent
the auditing of critical events. Misconfigured audits may degrade the system's
performance by overwhelming the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also make
it more difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating
to an incident or identify those responsible for one."
