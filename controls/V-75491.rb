72 hours or less."
  desc  "If temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for
an excessive period, these accounts may be used to gain unauthorized access. To
mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary accounts must be set
upon account creation.

    Temporary accounts are established as part of normal account activation
procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for
immediacy in account activation.

    If temporary accounts are used, the Ubuntu operating system must be
configured to automatically terminate these types of accounts after a
DoD-defined time period of 72 hours.

    To address access requirements, many Ubuntu operating systems may be
integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or
exceed access control policy requirements.
