  title "Passwords must have a minimum of 15-characters."
  desc  "The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible
combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a
password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password
length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long
it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to
exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to compromise the
password.
