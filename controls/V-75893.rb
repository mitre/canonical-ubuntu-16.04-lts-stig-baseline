Administrator (SA) (at a minimum) must have mail aliases to be notified of an
audit processing failure."
  desc  "It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system
is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this
notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of
the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely affected.

    Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the
audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or
exceeded.

    This requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e.,
distinct information system component where audit records are stored), the
centralized audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data
storage repositories combined), or both.
