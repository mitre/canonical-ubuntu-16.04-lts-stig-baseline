  title "All networked systems must have and implement SSH to protect the
confidentiality and integrity of transmitted and received information, as well
as information during preparation for transmission."
  desc  "Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and
integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be
intercepted and either read or altered.

    This requirement applies to both internal and external networks and all
types of information system components from which information can be
transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers,
copiers, scanners, and facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the
physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of
interception and modification.

    Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information
can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution
systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If
physical means of protection are employed, logical means (cryptography) do not
have to be employed, and vice versa.
