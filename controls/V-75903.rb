  title "The Ubuntu operating system must have the packages required for
multifactor authentication to be installed."
  desc  "Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is
separate from the information system, ensures that even if the information
system is compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on
the authentication device.

    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information
systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing
time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the
U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common Access
Card.

    A privileged account is defined as an information system account with
authorizations of a privileged user.

    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an
authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external,
non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for
example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the
function of the device or has the concept of an organizational user (e.g., VPN,
proxy capability). This does not apply to authentication for the purpose of
configuring the device itself (management).

    Requires further clarification from NIST.
