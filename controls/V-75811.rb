  title "A sticky bit must be set on all public directories to prevent
unauthorized and unintended information transferred via shared system
resources."
  desc  "Preventing unauthorized information transfers mitigates the risk of
information, including encrypted representations of information, produced by
the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf
of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or
current processes) that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g.,
registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been released
back to information systems. The control of information in shared resources is
also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.

    This requirement generally applies to the design of an information
technology product, but it can also apply to the configuration of particular
information system components that are, or use, such products. This can be
verified by acceptance/validation processes in DoD or other government agencies.

    There may be shared resources with configurable protections (e.g., files in
storage) that may be assessed on specific information system components.
