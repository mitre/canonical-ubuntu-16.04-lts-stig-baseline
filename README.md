## Running This Profile
When the __"runner"__ host uses this profile overlay for the first time, follow these steps: 

```
mkdir profiles
cd profiles
git clone https://github.com/mitre/canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-baseline.git
cd canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-baseline
bundle install
cd ..
inspec exec canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-baseline [-t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo] --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```
For every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this profile:

```
cd profiles/canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-baseline
git pull
cd ..
inspec exec canonical-ubuntu-16.04-lts-stig-baseline [-t ssh://<hostname>:<port> --sudo] --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```

## Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://mitre.github.io/heimdall-lite/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __full heimdall server__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.
