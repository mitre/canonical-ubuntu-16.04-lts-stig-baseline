|Quality checks|Alignment (including tagging) to original<br> standard (i.e. STIG, CIS Benchmark, NIST Tags)| Mo|08/09/19|*|
| |Control robustness (can the control be improved to make it less brittle - not necessarily a blocker on initial releases)| |||

| Error handling |“Profile Error” containment: “null” responses <br>should only happen if InSpec is run with incorrect privileges (e.g., code fails to reach a describe statement for every control. inspec check can do this. It will say no defined tests)| |||

| |Check for risky commands (e.g. rm, del, purge, etc.)| Mo|08/09/19|*|
| |Check for “stuck” situations (e.g., profile goes on forever due to infinite loop, very large data sets, etc.)| Mo|08/09/19|*|

Another tip is to cat all the controls into a single file so you don't have to open every individaul file and try to keep track of where you are and which one is next.
